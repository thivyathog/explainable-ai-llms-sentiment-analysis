# Integration of Explainable AI Techniques with Large Language Models for Enhanced Interpretability for Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction

Sentiment Analysis has experienced rapid growth due to advancements in deep learning. It has emerged as a key application of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) within research communities, driven by its profound implications across diverse domains (Birjali et al., 2021; Sánchez-Rada & Iglesias, 2019). 

Sentiment Analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves interpreting emotions expressed in text to determine its polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) (Mohammad, 2016). It offers valuable insights into public opinion, customer satisfaction, and sentiment towards products, services, or events. Automated sentiment classification allows businesses to receive immediate feedback, recognize trends, and make data-driven decisions.

Prominent domains for sentiment analysis include business intelligence, review analysis, the stock market, and healthcare (Birjali et al., 2021). For instance, in business intelligence, it helps analyze customer perceptions, facilitating informed decisions for both producers and consumers (Mohammad, 2016).

Traditional sentiment analysis models have relied on rule-based systems or statistical methods (Sánchez-Rada & Iglesias, 2019). These include the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model, lexicon-based approaches, and machine learning methods like SVM, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression. However, they often fail to capture language nuances and context-dependent sentiment variations (Abirami & Gayathri, 2017).

With the rise of deep learning and large language models (LLMs) like GPT and BERT, the accuracy and complexity of sentiment analysis have significantly improved (Sánchez-Rada & Iglesias, 2019). LLMs leverage advanced techniques to capture contextual information, understand linguistic nuances, handle complex sentence structures, and achieve state-of-the-art performance (Chang et al., 2024). They use attention mechanisms and contextual embeddings to analyze text in context, leading to more accurate sentiment analysis. Additionally, LLMs learn from vast amounts of text data, enabling them to recognize sarcasm, irony, and figurative expressions (Zhao et al., 2024).

Despite their performance, LLMs' black-box nature raises questions about their trustworthiness (Durán & Jongsma, 2021; Von Eschenbach, 2021). The lack of transparency poses challenges in understanding and trusting their results, especially in sensitive applications like sentiment analysis. This underscores the need for explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance model interpretability.

## Problem Statement

The lack of transparency in Large Language Models (LLMs) poses significant challenges in understanding and trusting their predictions, particularly in sensitive applications like sentiment analysis. This highlights the need to integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance interpretability and user confidence in these models.

## Research Objective

To enhance the interpretability and transparency of sentiment analysis outcomes generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby fostering trust and understanding in the decision-making process of these models.

## Research Aims

1. Extraction of relevant elements within LLMs with their specific functions for sentiment analysis.
2. Development of an explainable AI technique to enable better understanding of relevant elements within LLMs to increase transparency in LLM-based sentiment analysis.

## Research Contribution

Design and develop an explainable AI technique specifically tailored to large language models for sentiment analysis. This will improve user confidence, trust, and the reliability of predictions in the context of sentiment analysis.
